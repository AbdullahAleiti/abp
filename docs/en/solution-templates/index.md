# Solution Templates

ABP provides pre-architected and production-ready templates to jump start a new solution. The following solution templates are provided out of the box:

* **[Single-Layer Solution](single-layer-web-application/index.md)**: A single-project solution. Recommended for building an application with a **simpler and easy to understand** architecture.
* **[Layered Solution](layered-web-application/index.md)**: A fully layered (multiple projects) solution based on [Domain Driven Design](https://docs-test.abp.io/en/unification/1/Domain-Driven-Design) practices. Recommended for long-term projects that need a **maintainable and extensible** codebase.
* **[Microservice Solution](microservice/index.md)**: A **distributed solution** to build **microservice systems**. It includes pre-built services, API gateways, web and mobile applications, Kubernetes and Helm configuration, and everything you need to start your large-scale microservice solution.
* **[Application Module](application-module/index.md)**: A template that can be used to create a **reusable [application module](../modules/index.md)** based on the [module development best practices & conventions](../framework/architecture/best-practices/Index.md). It is also suitable for creating **services** (with or without UI).
