ABP Suite requires an ABP solution to work on, that's why when you start it, you will see the following actions: `Add an existing solution`, `Create a new solution`.

## Add an existing solution

Adds your existing solution which was created from the [ABP CLI](../cli) or [abp.io](https://abp.io/get-started) website. You have to enter your `YourProject.sln` file path. It also works if you enter the directory of the `YourProject.sln` when there's single solution inside.
