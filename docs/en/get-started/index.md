# Get Started

Great that you've decided to create a new application with ABP. ABP provides multiple startup templates for different needs. Each startup template is a fine-tuned and production-ready .NET solution that you can immediately start to develop your application based on it.

Please select one of the following documents best fits for your application:

- **[Single-Layer Solution](single-layer-web-application.md)**: Creates a single-project solution. Recommended for building an application with a **simpler and easy to understand** architecture.
- **[Layered Solution Architecture](layered-web-application.md)**: A fully layered (multiple projects) solution based on [Domain Driven Design](https://docs-test.abp.io/en/unification/1/Domain-Driven-Design) practices. Recommended for long-term projects that need a **maintainable and extensible** codebase.
- **[Microservice Solution](microservice.md)**: A **distributed solution** to build **microservice systems**. It includes pre-built services, API gateways, web and mobile applications, Kubernetes and Helm configuration, and everything you need to start your large-scale microservice solution.
